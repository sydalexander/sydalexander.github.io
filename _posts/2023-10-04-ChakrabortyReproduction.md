Coming into this reproduction study, I felt a little apprehensive as I scrolled through the lines of code. I wasn't sure exactly how I could contribute, but by the end of the study I felt much more confident about what I could do. On a basic level, I learned how to navigate a study translated entirely into R markdown; I ran blocks of code and looked at the various deviations that had already taken place in order to improve the study. From this, I gained insight into the possibilities of what I could do in a reproduction study, which I can apply to later studies. 

Specifically for teaching purposes, I felt it was really useful to be given a list of possible things that we could fix. For example, knowing that we needed to make smaller changes, from fixing a table to removing a missing parameter to fix a choropleth map, were good first steps in learning how to do a reproduction study.

What have you learned from doing a reproduction study?
Has the reproduction deviated from the original study in any way?
If so, are the deviations improvements or errors?
Are there opportunities to further improve the study’s research design, reproducibility, or reproducibility for teaching purposes?
Are there opportunities to design meaningful replication studies to further test any theories established by this study?
Keep in mind, a blog post is for highlights : aim for a post to be a short and impactful advertisement for the full study… no more than two paragraphs.
