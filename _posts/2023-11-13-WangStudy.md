With the Wang study, we continued to work with Python, which is a new programming language to me. I gained more familiarity reading Python syntax and
working in a new computing environment.
By working through the reproduction study, I learned more about different modules, such as the osmnx modules, and how to impelement them.
In this vein, I also improved my troubleshooting abilites by reading through code documentation, and putting in my own data.
This was also my first time working remotely through super computers using CyberGISX.
Efficiency was a big concern of ours while working through this study given that we were working with such large data sets; \
several steps or functions took relatively long times to run.


Our primary modification to this study involved using the **osmnx.speed** module in order to simplify the code, improving both its legibility and its effiency. 

Something we attempted to improve upon in the code was to improve translation from hospital catchments into hexagons by revising the **overlap_calc** function.
Although we were unable to accomplish this, it would still be something worth revising in the future. One potential issue with Wang's study was that

Are there opportunities to design meaningful replication studies to further test any theories established by this study?
